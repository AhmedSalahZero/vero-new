/**
 * Shared "Forecasted Project Collection" (customer side) / "Forecasted
 * Suppliers Contract Payments" (supplier side) calculation.
 *
 * Formula per order (confirmed with project owner, 2026-09):
 *
 *   Forecast = Total Contract Amount
 *              − Total Invoice Settlement
 *                  (total_collected_amount_in_main_currency
 *                   + total_deductions_in_main_currency
 *                   + net_balance_in_main_currency)
 *              − Down Payment Balance
 *
 * net_balance is in there because the open part of an invoice is
 * already reported by the "Customers Invoices" / "Suppliers Invoices"
 * row; leaving it in the forecast counts the same money twice inside
 * one report.
 *
 * Everything is compared in the MAIN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. The invoice
 * side reads the *_in_main_currency columns directly, so nothing is
 * converted twice. The down payment tables carry no main-currency
 * column, so each row converts at the FX rate of the date its cash
 * actually moved (money_received.receiving_date /
 * money_payments.delivery_date) — the same date
 * CustomerInvoice::getDownPaymentsOverContracts() converts at.
 *
 * Because the order amount is stored in the contract's own currency,
 * each phase is converted to the main functional currency BEFORE the
 * deduction is applied to it (the deduction is already in main
 * currency). This is the opposite order from the previous formula,
 * which deducted in contract currency and converted afterwards.
 *
 * Note this formula subtracts SETTLED amounts, not open balances, so
 * a fully collected/paid invoice must NOT be filtered out —
 * 'paid_or_collected_status' is no longer used for the deduction.
 *
 * Previously this exact formula was duplicated once in CustomerInvoice
 * and once in SupplierInvoice, both with the same bug: the down
 * payment/invoice subtraction was reversed (`down_payment - invoiced`
 * instead of the other way around), which — combined with then
 * subtracting THAT from the order amount — silently turned a
 * subtraction into an addition, and both used gross amounts instead
 * of their settlement-aware balances. Consolidated here so a future
 * fix only has to happen once.
 *
 * ── Supplier side / PO allocations (added 2026-08) ──────────────────
 * A Purchase Order belongs to the SUPPLIER's own contract, never to a
 * Customer contract directly. So when $contractId is a Customer
 * contract (as it always is on the single Contract Cash Flow report),
 * "find POs directly owned by this contract" finds nothing — the only
 * link is the po_allocations table (Customer contract -> allocated PO
 * -> that PO's real Supplier contract), the same table the "Suppliers
 * Invoices" row already relies on. When $poAllocations is passed
 * (supplier side only), each allocated PO is ALSO included here,
 * weighted by its allocation_percentage — on top of, not instead of,
 * any PO the contract directly owns (relevant when $contractId is
 * itself a genuine Supplier contract, e.g. picked directly on the
 * Consolidated Cash Flow report), so no existing behavior changes.
 *
 * ── Supplier side / child contracts (contract_scope, added 2026-09) ─
 * po_allocations is the OPTIONAL, explicit way to attach a PO to a
 * Customer contract (the "Allocate" modal on a Purchase Order). The
 * ordinary one is contracts.parent_id: a Supplier contract created
 * under a Customer contract is that contract's child, and its POs are
 * what the Customer contract's "Supplier Contracts" popup lists. With
 * 'contract_scope' => 'supplier_children' the contract query walks
 * that link instead (children of $contractId), which is how
 * SupplierInvoice::getForecastedProjectPayment builds the "Forecasted
 * Project Payment" row. Two notes on that mode:
 *   - Currency is NOT filtered. A Supplier contract routinely bills in
 *     a different currency from the Customer contract it hangs under
 *     (e.g. a EUR supplier under a USD project), and every amount is
 *     converted to the main functional currency below anyway — the
 *     same thing the "Suppliers Invoices" row already does.
 *   - POs already reachable through po_allocations for this same
 *     Customer contract are skipped ($excludeOrderIds), so a PO that
 *     happens to be linked BOTH ways is counted once, by the
 *     po_allocations row, and never twice.
 *
 * ── Currency selection ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * $currency accepts either a single currency code or a LIST of codes.
 * The list form is what the Consolidated Cash Flow report passes (it
 * has an explicit multi-currency picker) and always narrows contracts
 * to exactly those currencies. For the single-code form, the
 * company-wide report viewing the MAIN functional currency tab widens
 * to every currency instead — each contract's own amounts are then
 * converted via its own FX rate below — while any specific foreign
 * currency tab, or a single contract, keeps the strict
 * same-currency-only filter.
