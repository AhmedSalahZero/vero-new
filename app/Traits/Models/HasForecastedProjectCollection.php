/**
 * Shared "Forecasted Project Collection" (customer side) / "Forecasted
 * Suppliers Contract Payments" (supplier side) calculation.
 *
 * Formula per order (confirmed with project owner, 2026-08):
 *
 *   Forecast = Order Amount − Unused Down Payment Balance
 *              − Σ(each linked invoice's own net_balance)
 *
 * Both halves are already settlement-aware at the data level, so no
 * special-case branching is needed here for "invoice fully/partially
 * settled by down payment":
 *   - "Unused Down Payment Balance" reads down_payment_balance — NOT
 *     the original down_payment_amount — which is the portion of a
 *     down payment still not applied to any invoice.
 *   - Each invoice's own net_balance already reflects any down
 *     payment settlement applied against IT specifically (see
 *     DownPaymentContractsController / IsInvoice::calculateNetBalanceInEditMode).
 *     A fully down-payment-settled invoice has net_balance = 0 and so
 *     contributes nothing here (avoiding double-counting against the
 *     down payment deduction above); a partially-settled invoice
 *     contributes only its remaining balance.
 *
 * Previously this exact formula was duplicated once in CustomerInvoice
 * and once in SupplierInvoice, both with the same bug: the down
 * payment/invoice subtraction was reversed (`down_payment - invoiced`
 * instead of the other way around), which — combined with then
 * subtracting THAT from the order amount — silently turned a
 * subtraction into an addition, and both used gross amounts instead
 * of their settlement-aware balances. Consolidated here so a future
 * fix only has to happen once.
 *
 * ── Supplier side / PO allocations (added 2026-08) ──────────────────
 * A Purchase Order belongs to the SUPPLIER's own contract, never to a
 * Customer contract directly. So when $contractId is a Customer
 * contract (as it always is on the single Contract Cash Flow report),
 * "find POs directly owned by this contract" finds nothing — the only
 * link is the po_allocations table (Customer contract -> allocated PO
 * -> that PO's real Supplier contract), the same table the "Suppliers
 * Invoices" row already relies on. When $poAllocations is passed
 * (supplier side only), each allocated PO is ALSO included here,
 * weighted by its allocation_percentage — on top of, not instead of,
 * any PO the contract directly owns (relevant when $contractId is
 * itself a genuine Supplier contract, e.g. picked directly on the
 * Consolidated Cash Flow report), so no existing behavior changes.
 *
 * ── Currency selection ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * $currency accepts either a single currency code or a LIST of codes.
 * The list form is what the Consolidated Cash Flow report passes (it
 * has an explicit multi-currency picker) and always narrows contracts
 * to exactly those currencies. For the single-code form, the
 * company-wide report viewing the MAIN functional currency tab widens
 * to every currency instead — each contract's own amounts are then
 * converted via its own FX rate below — while any specific foreign
 * currency tab, or a single contract, keeps the strict
 * same-currency-only filter.
