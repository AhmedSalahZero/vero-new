/**
 * OdooSync
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Odoo is a remote XML-RPC service. Any call to it can fail in two ways:
 *
 *   - the server is unreachable / times out  → ripcord throws
 *     Ripcord_TransportException (see public/apis/ripcord_client.php)
 *   - the server answers with a faultCode    → AuthTrait::execute() throws
 *     \Exception($faultString)
 *
 * Both used to escape all the way up to the exception handler. That is what
 * made the money-payment / money-received / LG-issuance / cash-expense flows
 * dangerous: update() is implemented as "deleteRelations() → delete() →
 * store()" with no transaction, so an Odoo failure in the middle left the
 * record half deleted, or deleted the old record and created a new one that
 * was never linked to Odoo.
 *
 * This class fixes both halves of the problem, without queues/jobs:
 *
 *   1. transaction() runs the local database work inside a real DB
 *      transaction, so it either fully happens or fully rolls back.
 *   2. defer() registers an Odoo call instead of running it inline. The
 *      registered calls run in FIFO order *after* the transaction commits, so
 *      no XML-RPC round trip is ever made while a transaction is open, and a
 *      failing call cannot roll back local data.
 *   3. run() (used internally for every deferred call) swallows the failure
 *      and records it on the model as synced_with_odoo = 0 +
 *      odoo_error_message, plus a flash message for the user — the same
 *      pattern OdooPayment::createDownPayment already used.
 *
 * defer() outside of any transaction() falls back to running the call
 * immediately (still guarded), so call sites converted to defer() keep
 * working from code paths that have not been wrapped.
