/**
 * A down payment received or paid BY CHEQUE has to be recorded in Odoo as a
 * cheque, not as cash.
 *
 * What went wrong: createNonCustomerOrSupplierOdooExpense() routed a cheque
 * to createDownPayment() only when the partner was NOT a customer or
 * supplier. A customer's down-payment cheque therefore fell through to the
 * raw journal entry below it, which debits the BRANCH'S CASH account. The
 * later collection credits Notes Receivable — a different account — so the
 * safe was never relieved:
 *
 *      receive:  Dr 251 Cash On Hand      1,000,000
 *      collect:  Dr Bank                  1,000,000
 *                Cr 406 Notes Receivable  1,000,000
 *
 *      => safe +1,000,000 AND bank +1,000,000 for one 1,000,000 cheque.
 *
 * Verified against the live Odoo 18 Enterprise instance: payment method
 * line 414 ("Cheque Rec" on the Cash On Hand journal) carries outstanding
 * account 406, which is exactly what chequeCollection() credits — so
 * routing the cheque through createDownPayment() makes the two sides net
 * to zero.
