/**
 * The Settlement Details modal (SettlementsInfoButton.vue) must show the
 * invoice amount AFTER tax.
 *
 * It used to show getInvoiceAmount() — the raw pre-VAT column — while the
 * Money Received / Money Payment form screens show net_invoice_amount under
 * the very same "Invoice Amount" label, and while the settlement itself is
 * measured against the net (net_balance). So the same label gave two
 * different numbers, and a settlement could look larger than the "invoice
 * amount" printed next to it.
 *
 *      net_invoice_amount = invoice_amount + vat_amount − discount_amount
 *
 * Both Money Received and Money Payment are covered by one test each because
 * they share getSettlementsInfo() in the IsMoney trait but resolve different
 * invoice models (CustomerInvoice vs SupplierInvoice).
